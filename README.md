<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>The Darts Scoreing App offers the possibility to play darts in real life through different game modes in order to improve your darts skills. In game modes 501/301 you can play against a bot that simulates a virtual opponent. However, you can also play in multiplayer mode with your friends</p>


<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Programming different game modes</li>
  <li>Create Bots which are supposed to represent a virtual opponent</li>
  <li>All data should be stored in a MySQL database</li>
  <li>The data should be visualized in a helpful way</li>
</ul>
